# Prodigy Data Science Internship Task 2
This repository contains the code for Task 2 of the Prodigy Data Science Internship. The task involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics and survival rates.

## Task Description
"Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data."
## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including details such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status.

## Code Overview
The provided code performs the following tasks:
- Loads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file
- Cleans the data by handling missing values in the "Embarked" and "Cabin" columns
- Fills missing values in the "Age" column with the mean age of passengers
- Generates visualizations to analyze the distribution of passenger ages, passenger class distribution, age distribution by passenger class, survival by gender, and a scatter plot of age vs fare with survival status indicated
